# Slyshow

> `$ slyshow file[file...]`

Simple bash tool and script for creating a minimal slideshow.

["How To Speak by Patrick Winston"][1] inspired me to make this tool.

Slyshow will only allow you to show 4 lines of centered text.

## Requirements

Requires **bash** because it is written for it, **less** for displaying the
generated text in and **tput** to determine width, height, bold and normal
text.
